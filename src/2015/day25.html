        <h2>--- Day 25: Let It Snow ---</h2>
        <p>Merry Christmas! Santa is booting up his weather machine; looks like you might get a <a
            href="day01.html">white Christmas</a> after all.</p>
        <p>The weather machine beeps! On the console of the machine is a copy protection message asking you to <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_protection#Early_video_games">enter a code from the instruction
            manual</a>. Apparently, it refuses to run unless you give it that code. No problem; you'll just look up the
          code in the--</p>
        <p>"Ho ho ho", Santa ponders aloud. "I can't seem to find the manual."</p>
        <p>You look up the support number for the manufacturer and give them a call. Good thing, too - that 49th star
          wasn't going to earn itself.</p>
        <p>"Oh, that machine is quite old!", they tell you. "That model went out of support six minutes ago, and we just
          finished shredding all of the manuals. I bet we can find you the code generation algorithm, though."</p>
        <p>After putting you on hold for twenty minutes (your call is <em>very</em> important to them, it reminded you
          repeatedly), they finally find an engineer that remembers how the code system works.</p>
        <p>The codes are printed on an <span
            title="The paper is very thin so it can be folded up neatly into the manual.">infinite sheet of
            paper</span>, starting in the top-left corner. The codes are filled in by diagonals: starting with the first
          row with an empty first box, the codes are filled in diagonally up and to the right. This process repeats
          until the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor's_diagonal_argument">infinite paper is covered</a>.
          So, the first few codes are filled in in this order:</p>
        <pre><code>   | 1   2   3   4   5   6
---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 1 |  1   3   6  10  15  21
 2 |  2   5   9  14  20
 3 |  4   8  13  19
 4 |  7  12  18
 5 | 11  17
 6 | 16
</code></pre>
        <p>For example, the 12th code would be written to row <code>4</code>, column <code>2</code>; the 15th code would
          be written to row <code>1</code>, column <code>5</code>.</p>
        <p>The voice on the other end of the phone continues with how the codes are actually generated. The first code
          is <code>20151125</code>. After that, each code is generated by taking the previous one, multiplying it by
          <code>252533</code>, and then keeping the remainder from dividing that value by <code>33554393</code>.</p>
        <p>So, to find the second code (which ends up in row <code>2</code>, column <code>1</code>), start with the
          previous value, <code>20151125</code>. Multiply it by <code>252533</code> to get <code>5088824049625</code>.
          Then, divide that by <code>33554393</code>, which leaves a remainder of <code>31916031</code>. That remainder
          is the second code.</p>
        <p>"Oh!", says the voice. "It looks like we missed a scrap from one of the manuals. Let me read it to you." You
          write down his numbers:</p>
        <pre><code>   |    1         2         3         4         5         6

</code></pre>
        <p>"Now remember", the voice continues, "that's not even all of the first few numbers; for example, you're
          missing the one at 7,1 that would come before 6,2. But, it should be enough to let your-- oh, it's time for
          lunch! Bye!" The call disconnects.</p>
        <p>Santa looks nervous. Your puzzle input contains the message on the machine's console. <em>What code do you
            give the machine?</em></p>

      <p>Your puzzle answer was <code>9132360</code>.</p>

        <p>The machine springs to life, then falls silent again. It beeps. "Insufficient fuel", the console reads. "<em
            class="star">Fifty stars</em> are required before proceeding. <em class="star">One star</em> is available."
        </p>
        <p>..."one star is available"? You check the fuel tank; sure enough, a lone star sits at the bottom, awaiting
          its friends. Looks like you need to provide 49 yourself.</p>

<style>article *[title]{border-bottom:1px dotted #ffff66;}</style><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 19: Medicine for Rudolph ---</h2><p>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is sick!  His nose isn't shining very brightly, and he needs medicine.</p>
<p>Red-Nosed Reindeer biology isn't similar to regular reindeer biology; Rudolph is going to need custom-made medicine.  Unfortunately, Red-Nosed Reindeer chemistry isn't similar to regular reindeer chemistry, either.</p>
<p>The North Pole is equipped with a Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion/fission plant, capable of constructing any Red-Nosed Reindeer molecule you need.  It works by starting with some input molecule and then doing a series of <em>replacements</em>, one per step, until it has the right molecule.</p>
<p>However, the machine has to be calibrated before it can be used.  Calibration involves determining the number of molecules that can be generated in one step from a given starting point.</p>
<p>For example, imagine a simpler machine that supports only the following replacements:</p>
<pre><code>H => HO
H => OH
O => HH
</code></pre>
<p>Given the replacements above and starting with <code>HOH</code>, the following molecules could be generated:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>HOOH</code> (via <code>H => HO</code> on the first <code>H</code>).</li>
<li><code>HOHO</code> (via <code>H => HO</code> on the second <code>H</code>).</li>
<li><code>OHOH</code> (via <code>H => OH</code> on the first <code>H</code>).</li>
<li><code>HOOH</code> (via <code>H => OH</code> on the second <code>H</code>).</li>
<li><code>HHHH</code> (via <code>O => HH</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in the example above, there are <code>4</code> <em>distinct</em> molecules (not five, because <code>HOOH</code> appears twice) after one replacement from <code>HOH</code>. Santa's favorite molecule, <code>HOHOHO</code>, can become <code>7</code> <em>distinct</em> molecules (over nine replacements: six from <code>H</code>, and three from <code>O</code>).</p>
<p>The machine replaces without regard for the surrounding characters.  For example, given the string <code>H2O</code>, the transition <code>H => OO</code> would result in <code>OO2O</code>.</p>
<p>Your puzzle input describes all of the possible replacements and, at the bottom, the medicine molecule for which you need to calibrate the machine.  <em>How many distinct molecules can be created</em> after all the different ways you can do one replacement on the medicine molecule?</p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>576</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Now that the machine is calibrated, you're ready to begin molecule fabrication.</p>
<p>Molecule fabrication always begins with just a single <span title="It's a Red-Nosed Reindeer electron.">electron</span>, <code>e</code>, and applying replacements one at a time, just like the ones during calibration.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have the following replacements:</p>
<pre><code>e => H
e => O
H => HO
H => OH
O => HH
</code></pre>
<p>If you'd like to make <code>HOH</code>, you start with <code>e</code>, and then make the following replacements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>e => O</code> to get <code>O</code></li>
<li><code>O => HH</code> to get <code>HH</code></li>
<li><code>H => OH</code> (on the second <code>H</code>) to get <code>HOH</code></li>
</ul>
<p>So, you could make <code>HOH</code> after <em><code>3</code> steps</em>.  Santa's favorite molecule, <code>HOHOHO</code>, can be made in <em><code>6</code> steps</em>.</p>
<p>How long will it take to make the medicine?  Given the available <em>replacements</em> and the <em>medicine molecule</em> in your puzzle input, what is the <em>fewest number of steps</em> to go from <code>e</code> to the medicine molecule?</p>

<style>article *[title]{border-bottom:1px dotted #ffff66;}</style><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 16: Aunt Sue ---</h2><p>Your Aunt Sue has given you a wonderful gift, and you'd like to send her a thank you card.  However, there's a small problem: she signed it "From, Aunt Sue".</p>
<p>You have 500 Aunts named "Sue".</p>
<p>So, to avoid sending the card to the wrong person, you need to figure out which Aunt Sue (which you conveniently number 1 to 500, for sanity) gave you the gift.  You open the present and, as luck would have it, good ol' Aunt Sue got you a My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine!  Just what you wanted.  Or needed, as the case may be.</p>
<p>The My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine (MFCSAM for short) can detect a few specific compounds in a given sample, as well as how many distinct kinds of those compounds there are. According to the instructions, these are what the MFCSAM can detect:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>children</code>, by human DNA age analysis.</li>
<li><code>cats</code>.  It doesn't differentiate individual breeds.</li>
<li>Several <span title="It can tell them apart by their distinct Dog Residue.">seemingly random breeds of dog</span>: <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoyed_%28dog%29">samoyeds</a></code>, <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomeranian_%28dog%29">pomeranians</a></code>, <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akita_%28dog%29">akitas</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizsla">vizslas</a></code>.</li>
<li><code>goldfish</code>.  No other kinds of fish.</li>
<li><code>trees</code>, all in one group.</li>
<li><code>cars</code>, presumably by exhaust or gasoline or something.</li>
<li><code>perfumes</code>, which is handy, since many of your Aunts Sue wear a few kinds.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, many of your Aunts Sue have many of these.  You put the wrapping from the gift into the MFCSAM.  It beeps inquisitively at you a few times and then prints out a message on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticker_tape">ticker tape</a>:</p>
<pre><code>children: 3
cats: 7
samoyeds: 2
pomeranians: 3
akitas: 0
vizslas: 0
goldfish: 5
trees: 3
cars: 2
perfumes: 1
</code></pre>
<p>You make a list of the things you can remember about each Aunt Sue.  Things missing from your list aren't zero - you simply don't remember the value.</p>
<p>What is the <em>number</em> of the Sue that got you the gift?</p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>213</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>As you're about to send the thank you note, something in the MFCSAM's instructions catches your eye.  Apparently, it has an outdated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXJKdh1KZ0w">retroencabulator</a>, and so the output from the machine isn't exact values - some of them indicate ranges.</p>
<p>In particular, the <code>cats</code> and <code>trees</code> readings indicates that there are <em>greater than</em> that many (due to the unpredictable nuclear decay of cat dander and tree pollen), while the <code>pomeranians</code> and <code>goldfish</code> readings indicate that there are <em>fewer than</em> that many (due to the modial interaction of magnetoreluctance).</p>
<p>What is the <em>number</em> of the real Aunt Sue?</p>

<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>323</code>.</p><p class="day-success">Both parts of this puzzle are complete! They provide two gold stars: **</p>

<style>article *[title]{border-bottom:1px dotted #ffff66;}</style><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 24: Immune System Simulator 20XX ---</h2><p>After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDVjLt_QHL8&t=7" target="_blank">a weird buzzing noise</a>, you appear back at the man's cottage. He seems relieved to see his friend, but quickly notices that the little reindeer caught some kind of cold while out exploring.</p>
<p>The portly man explains that this reindeer's immune system isn't similar to regular reindeer immune systems:</p>
<p>The <em>immune system</em> and the <em>infection</em> each have <span title="On second thought, it's pretty similar to regular reindeer immune systems.">an army</span> made up of several <em>groups</em>; each <em>group</em> consists of one or more identical <em>units</em>.  The armies repeatedly <em>fight</em> until only one army has units remaining.</p>
<p><em>Units</em> within a group all have the same <em>hit points</em> (amount of damage a unit can take before it is destroyed), <em>attack damage</em> (the amount of damage each unit deals), an <em>attack type</em>, an <em>initiative</em> (higher initiative units attack first and win ties), and sometimes <em>weaknesses</em> or <em>immunities</em>. Here is an example group:</p>
<pre><code>18 units each with 729 hit points (weak to fire; immune to cold, slashing)
 with an attack that does 8 radiation damage at initiative 10
</code></pre>
<p>Each group also has an <em>effective power</em>: the number of units in that group multiplied by their attack damage. The above group has an effective power of <code>18 * 8 = 144</code>. Groups never have zero or negative units; instead, the group is removed from combat.</p>
<p>Each <em>fight</em> consists of two phases: <em>target selection</em> and <em>attacking</em>.</p>
<p>During the <em>target selection</em> phase, each group attempts to choose one target. In decreasing order of effective power, groups choose their targets; in a tie, the group with the higher initiative chooses first. The attacking group chooses to target the group in the enemy army to which it would deal the most damage (after accounting for weaknesses and immunities, but not accounting for whether the defending group has enough units to actually receive all of that damage).</p>
<p>If an attacking group is considering two defending groups to which it would deal equal damage, it chooses to target the defending group with the largest effective power; if there is still a tie, it chooses the defending group with the highest initiative.  If it cannot deal any defending groups damage, it does not choose a target.  Defending groups can only be chosen as a target by one attacking group.</p>
<p>At the end of the target selection phase, each group has selected zero or one groups to attack, and each group is being attacked by zero or one groups.</p>
<p>During the <em>attacking</em> phase, each group deals damage to the target it selected, if any. Groups attack in decreasing order of initiative, regardless of whether they are part of the infection or the immune system. (If a group contains no units, it cannot attack.)</p>
<p>The damage an attacking group deals to a defending group depends on the attacking group's attack type and the defending group's immunities and weaknesses.  By default, an attacking group would deal damage equal to its <em>effective power</em> to the defending group.  However, if the defending group is <em>immune</em> to the attacking group's attack type, the defending group instead takes <em>no damage</em>; if the defending group is <em>weak</em> to the attacking group's attack type, the defending group instead takes <em>double damage</em>.</p>
<p>The defending group only loses <em>whole units</em> from damage; damage is always dealt in such a way that it kills the most units possible, and any remaining damage to a unit that does not immediately kill it is ignored. For example, if a defending group contains <code>10</code> units with <code>10</code> hit points each and receives <code>75</code> damage, it loses exactly <code>7</code> units and is left with <code>3</code> units at full health.</p>
<p>After the fight is over, if both armies still contain units, a new fight begins; combat only ends once one army has lost all of its units.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following armies:</p>
<pre><code>Immune System:
17 units each with 5390 hit points (weak to radiation, bludgeoning) with
 an attack that does 4507 fire damage at initiative 2
989 units each with 1274 hit points (immune to fire; weak to bludgeoning,
 slashing) with an attack that does 25 slashing damage at initiative 3

Infection:
801 units each with 4706 hit points (weak to radiation) with an attack
 that does 116 bludgeoning damage at initiative 1
4485 units each with 2961 hit points (immune to radiation; weak to fire,
 cold) with an attack that does 12 slashing damage at initiative 4
</code></pre>
<p>If these armies were to enter combat, the following fights, including details during the target selection and attacking phases, would take place:</p>
<pre><code>Immune System:

</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, the winning army ends up with <code>782 + 4434 = <em>5216</em></code> units.</p>
<p>You scan the reindeer's condition (your puzzle input); the white-bearded man looks nervous.  As it stands now, <em>how many units would the winning army have</em>?</p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>26753</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Things aren't looking good for the reindeer. The man asks whether more milk and cookies would help you think.</p>
<p>If only you could give the reindeer's immune system a boost, you might be able to change the outcome of the combat.</p>
<p>A <em>boost</em> is an integer increase in immune system units' attack damage. For example, if you were to boost the above example's immune system's units by <code>1570</code>, the armies would instead look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Immune System:
17 units each with 5390 hit points (weak to radiation, bludgeoning) with
 an attack that does <em>6077</em> fire damage at initiative 2
989 units each with 1274 hit points (immune to fire; weak to bludgeoning,
 slashing) with an attack that does <em>1595</em> slashing damage at initiative 3

Infection:
801 units each with 4706 hit points (weak to radiation) with an attack
 that does 116 bludgeoning damage at initiative 1
4485 units each with 2961 hit points (immune to radiation; weak to fire,
 cold) with an attack that does 12 slashing damage at initiative 4
</code></pre>
<p>With this boost, the combat proceeds differently:</p>
<pre><code>Immune System:
Group 2 contains 989 units
Group 1 contains 17 units
Infection:

<p>This boost would allow the immune system's armies to win! It would be left with <code><em>51</em></code> units.</p>
<p>You don't even know <em>how</em> you could boost the reindeer's immune system or what effect it might have, so you need to be cautious and find the <em>smallest boost</em> that would allow the immune system to win.</p>
<p><em>How many units does the immune system have left</em> after getting the smallest boost it needs to win?</p>

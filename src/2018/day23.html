<style>article *[title]{border-bottom:1px dotted #ffff66;}</style><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 23: Experimental Emergency Teleportation ---</h2><p>Using your torch to search the darkness of the rocky cavern, you finally locate the man's friend: a small <em>reindeer</em>.</p>
<p>You're not sure how it got so far in this cave.  It looks sick - too sick to walk - and too heavy for you to carry all the way back.  Sleighs won't be invented for another 1500 years, of course.</p>
<p>The only option is <em>experimental emergency teleportation</em>.</p>
<p>You hit the "experimental emergency teleportation" <span title="We've always had this button; we've just been too scared to press it.">button</span> on the device and push <em>I accept the risk</em> on no fewer than 18 different warning messages. Immediately, the device deploys hundreds of tiny <em>nanobots</em> which fly around the cavern, apparently assembling themselves into a very specific <em>formation</em>. The device lists the <code>X,Y,Z</code> position (<code>pos</code>) for each nanobot as well as its <em>signal radius</em> (<code>r</code>) on its tiny screen (your puzzle input).</p>
<p>Each nanobot can transmit signals to any integer coordinate which is a distance away from it <em>less than or equal to</em> its signal radius (as measured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">Manhattan distance</a>). Coordinates a distance away of less than or equal to a nanobot's signal radius are said to be <em>in range</em> of that nanobot.</p>
<p>Before you start the teleportation process, you should determine which nanobot is the <em>strongest</em> (that is, which has the largest signal radius) and then, for that nanobot, the <em>total number of nanobots that are in range</em> of it, <em>including itself</em>.</p>
<p>For example, given the following nanobots:</p>
<pre><code>pos=&lt;0,0,0&gt;, r=4
pos=&lt;1,0,0&gt;, r=1
pos=&lt;4,0,0&gt;, r=3
pos=&lt;0,2,0&gt;, r=1
pos=&lt;0,5,0&gt;, r=3
pos=&lt;0,0,3&gt;, r=1
pos=&lt;1,1,1&gt;, r=1
pos=&lt;1,1,2&gt;, r=1
pos=&lt;1,3,1&gt;, r=1
</code></pre>
<p>The strongest nanobot is the first one (position <code>0,0,0</code>) because its signal radius, <code>4</code> is the largest. Using that nanobot's location and signal radius, the following nanobots are in or out of range:</p>
<ul>
<li>The nanobot at <code>0,0,0</code> is distance <code>0</code> away, and so it is <em>in range</em>.</li>
<li>The nanobot at <code>1,0,0</code> is distance <code>1</code> away, and so it is <em>in range</em>.</li>
<li>The nanobot at <code>4,0,0</code> is distance <code>4</code> away, and so it is <em>in range</em>.</li>
<li>The nanobot at <code>0,2,0</code> is distance <code>2</code> away, and so it is <em>in range</em>.</li>
<li>The nanobot at <code>0,5,0</code> is distance <code>5</code> away, and so it is <em>not</em> in range.</li>
<li>The nanobot at <code>0,0,3</code> is distance <code>3</code> away, and so it is <em>in range</em>.</li>
<li>The nanobot at <code>1,1,1</code> is distance <code>3</code> away, and so it is <em>in range</em>.</li>
<li>The nanobot at <code>1,1,2</code> is distance <code>4</code> away, and so it is <em>in range</em>.</li>
<li>The nanobot at <code>1,3,1</code> is distance <code>5</code> away, and so it is <em>not</em> in range.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, in total, <code><em>7</em></code> nanobots are in range of the nanobot with the largest signal radius.</p>
<p>Find the nanobot with the largest signal radius.  <em>How many nanobots are in range</em> of its signals?</p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>933</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Now, you just need to figure out where to position yourself so that you're actually teleported when the nanobots activate.</p>
<p>To increase the probability of success, you need to find the coordinate which puts you <em>in range of the largest number of nanobots</em>. If there are multiple, choose one <em>closest to your position</em> (<code>0,0,0</code>, measured by manhattan distance).</p>
<p>For example, given the following nanobot formation:</p>
<pre><code>pos=&lt;10,12,12&gt;, r=2
pos=&lt;12,14,12&gt;, r=2
pos=&lt;16,12,12&gt;, r=4
pos=&lt;14,14,14&gt;, r=6
pos=&lt;50,50,50&gt;, r=200
pos=&lt;10,10,10&gt;, r=5
</code></pre>
<p>Many coordinates are in range of some of the nanobots in this formation.  However, only the coordinate <code>12,12,12</code> is in range of the most nanobots: it is in range of the first five, but is not in range of the nanobot at <code>10,10,10</code>. (All other coordinates are in range of fewer than five nanobots.) This coordinate's distance from <code>0,0,0</code> is <code><em>36</em></code>.</p>
<p>Find the coordinates that are in range of the largest number of nanobots. <em>What is the shortest manhattan distance between any of those points and <code>0,0,0</code>?</em></p>

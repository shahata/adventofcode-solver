        <h2>--- Day 3: No Matter How You Slice It ---</h2>
        <p>The Elves managed to locate the chimney-squeeze prototype fabric for Santa's suit (thanks to <span
            title="WAS IT YOU">someone</span> who helpfully wrote its box IDs on the wall of the warehouse in the middle
          of the night). Unfortunately, anomalies are still affecting them - nobody can even agree on how to
          <em>cut</em> the fabric.</p>
        <p>The whole piece of fabric they're working on is a very large square - at least <code>1000</code> inches on
          each side.</p>
        <p>Each Elf has made a <em>claim</em> about which area of fabric would be ideal for Santa's suit. All claims
          have an ID and consist of a single rectangle with edges parallel to the edges of the fabric. Each claim's
          rectangle is defined as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The number of inches between the left edge of the fabric and the left edge of the rectangle.</li>
          <li>The number of inches between the top edge of the fabric and the top edge of the rectangle.</li>
          <li>The width of the rectangle in inches.</li>
          <li>The height of the rectangle in inches.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A claim like <code>#123 @ 3,2: 5x4</code> means that claim ID <code>123</code> specifies a rectangle
          <code>3</code> inches from the left edge, <code>2</code> inches from the top edge, <code>5</code> inches wide,
          and <code>4</code> inches tall. Visually, it claims the square inches of fabric represented by <code>#</code>
          (and ignores the square inches of fabric represented by <code>.</code>) in the diagram below:</p>
        <pre><code>...........
...........
...#####...
...#####...
...#####...
...#####...
...........
...........
...........
</code></pre>
        <p>The problem is that many of the claims <em>overlap</em>, causing two or more claims to cover part of the same
          areas. For example, consider the following claims:</p>
        <pre><code>#1 @ 1,3: 4x4
#2 @ 3,1: 4x4
#3 @ 5,5: 2x2
</code></pre>
        <p>Visually, these claim the following areas:</p>
        <pre><code>........
...2222.
...2222.
.11XX22.
.11XX22.
.111133.
.111133.
........
</code></pre>
        <p>The four square inches marked with <code>X</code> are claimed by <em>both <code>1</code> and
            <code>2</code></em>. (Claim <code>3</code>, while adjacent to the others, does not overlap either of them.)
        </p>
        <p>If the Elves all proceed with their own plans, none of them will have enough fabric. <em>How many square
            inches of fabric are within two or more claims?</em></p>
      </article>
      <p>Your puzzle answer was <code>109143</code>.</p>
      <article class="day-desc">
        <h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2>
        <p>Amidst the chaos, you notice that exactly one claim doesn't overlap by even a single square inch of fabric
          with any other claim. If you can somehow draw attention to it, maybe the Elves will be able to make Santa's
          suit after all!</p>
        <p>For example, in the claims above, only claim <code>3</code> is intact after all claims are made.</p>
        <p><em>What is the ID of the only claim that doesn't overlap?</em></p>
      </article>
      <p>Your puzzle answer was <code>506</code>.</p>

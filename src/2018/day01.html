<style>article *[title]{border-bottom:1px dotted #ffff66;}</style><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 1: Chronal Calibration ---</h2><p>"We've detected some temporal anomalies," one of Santa's Elves at the <span title="It's about as big on the inside as you expected.">Temporal Anomaly Research and Detection Instrument Station</span> tells you. She sounded pretty worried when she called you down here. "At 500-year intervals into the past, someone has been changing Santa's history!"</p>
<p>"The good news is that the changes won't propagate to our time stream for another 25 days, and we have a device" - she attaches something to your wrist - "that will let you fix the changes with no such propagation delay. It's configured to send you 500 years further into the past every few days; that was the best we could do on such short notice."</p>
<p>"The bad news is that we are detecting roughly <em>fifty</em> anomalies throughout time; the device will indicate fixed anomalies with <em class="star">stars</em>. The other bad news is that we only have one device and you're the best person for the job! Good lu--" She taps a button on the device and you suddenly feel like you're falling. To save Christmas, you need to get all <em class="star">fifty stars</em> by December 25th.</p>
<p>Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants <em class="star">one star</em>. Good luck!</p>
<p>After feeling like you've been falling for a few minutes, you look at the device's tiny screen. "Error: Device must be calibrated before first use. Frequency drift detected. Cannot maintain destination lock." Below the message, the device shows a sequence of changes in frequency (your puzzle input). A value like <code>+6</code> means the current frequency increases by <code>6</code>; a value like <code>-3</code> means the current frequency decreases by <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>For example, if the device displays frequency changes of <code>+1, -2, +3, +1</code>, then starting from a frequency of zero, the following changes would occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current frequency <code>&nbsp;0</code>, change of <code>+1</code>; resulting frequency <code>&nbsp;1</code>.</li>
<li>Current frequency <code>&nbsp;1</code>, change of <code>-2</code>; resulting frequency <code>-1</code>.</li>
<li>Current frequency <code>-1</code>, change of <code>+3</code>; resulting frequency <code>&nbsp;2</code>.</li>
<li>Current frequency <code>&nbsp;2</code>, change of <code>+1</code>; resulting frequency <code>&nbsp;3</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, the resulting frequency is <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>Here are other example situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+1, +1, +1</code> results in <code>&nbsp;3</code></li>
<li><code>+1, +1, -2</code> results in <code>&nbsp;0</code></li>
<li><code>-1, -2, -3</code> results in <code>-6</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Starting with a frequency of zero, <em>what is the resulting frequency</em> after all of the changes in frequency have been applied?</p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>531</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>You notice that the device repeats the same frequency change list over and over. To calibrate the device, you need to find the first frequency it reaches <em>twice</em>.</p>
<p>For example, using the same list of changes above, the device would loop as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current frequency <code>&nbsp;0</code>, change of <code>+1</code>; resulting frequency <code>&nbsp;1</code>.</li>
<li>Current frequency <code>&nbsp;1</code>, change of <code>-2</code>; resulting frequency <code>-1</code>.</li>
<li>Current frequency <code>-1</code>, change of <code>+3</code>; resulting frequency <code>&nbsp;2</code>.</li>
<li>Current frequency <code>&nbsp;2</code>, change of <code>+1</code>; resulting frequency <code>&nbsp;3</code>.</li>
<li>(At this point, the device continues from the start of the list.)</li>
<li>Current frequency <code>&nbsp;3</code>, change of <code>+1</code>; resulting frequency <code>&nbsp;4</code>.</li>
<li>Current frequency <code>&nbsp;4</code>, change of <code>-2</code>; resulting frequency <code>&nbsp;2</code>, which has already been seen.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, the first frequency reached twice is <code>2</code>. Note that your device might need to repeat its list of frequency changes many times before a duplicate frequency is found, and that duplicates might be found while in the middle of processing the list.</p>
<p>Here are other examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+1, -1</code> first reaches <code>0</code> twice.</li>
<li><code>+3, +3, +4, -2, -4</code> first reaches <code>10</code> twice.</li>
<li><code>-6, +3, +8, +5, -6</code> first reaches <code>5</code> twice.</li>
<li><code>+7, +7, -2, -7, -4</code> first reaches <code>14</code> twice.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What is the first frequency your device reaches twice?</em></p>

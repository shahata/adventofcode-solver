      <style>article *[title]{border-bottom:1px dotted #ffff66;}</style><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 25: Snowverload ---</h2><p><em>Still</em> somehow without snow, you go to the last place you haven't checked: the center of Snow Island, directly below the waterfall.</p>
<p>Here, someone has clearly been trying to fix the problem. Scattered everywhere are hundreds of weather machines, almanacs, communication modules, hoof prints, machine parts, mirrors, lenses, and so on.</p>
<p>Somehow, everything has been <em>wired together</em> into a massive snow-producing apparatus, but nothing seems to be running. You check a tiny screen on one of the communication modules: <code>Error 2023</code>. It doesn't say what <code>Error 2023</code> means, but it <em>does</em> have the phone number for a support line printed on it.</p>
<p>"Hi, you've reached Weather Machines And So On, Inc. How can I help you?" You explain the situation.</p>
<p>"Error 2023, you say? Why, that's a power overload error, of course! It means you have too many components plugged in. Try unplugging some components and--" You explain that there are hundreds of components here and you're in a bit of a hurry.</p>
<p>"Well, let's see how bad it is; do you see a <em>big red reset button</em> somewhere? It should be on its own module. If you push it, it probably won't fix anything, but it'll report how overloaded things are." After a minute or two, you find the reset button; it's so big that it takes two hands just to get enough leverage to push it. Its screen then displays:</p>
<pre><code>SYSTEM OVERLOAD!

Connected components would require
power equal to at least <em class="star">100 stars</em>!
</code></pre>
<p>"Wait, <em>how</em> many components did you say are plugged in? With that much equipment, you could produce snow for an <em>entire</em>--" You disconnect the call.</p>
<p>You have nowhere near that many stars - you need to find a way to disconnect at least half of the equipment here, but it's already Christmas! You only have time to disconnect <em>three wires</em>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, someone left a wiring diagram (your puzzle input) that shows <em>how the components are connected</em>. For example:</p>
<pre><code>jqt: rhn xhk nvd
rsh: frs pzl lsr
xhk: hfx
cmg: qnr nvd lhk bvb
rhn: xhk bvb hfx
bvb: xhk hfx
pzl: lsr hfx nvd
qnr: nvd
ntq: jqt hfx bvb xhk
nvd: lhk
lsr: lhk
rzs: qnr cmg lsr rsh
frs: qnr lhk lsr
</code></pre>
<p>Each line shows the <em>name of a component</em>, a colon, and then <em>a list of other components</em> to which that component is connected. Connections aren't directional; <code>abc: xyz</code> and <code>xyz: abc</code> both represent the same configuration. Each connection between two components is represented only once, so some components might only ever appear on the left or right side of a colon.</p>
<p>In this example, if you disconnect the wire between <code>hfx</code>/<code>pzl</code>, the wire between <code>bvb</code>/<code>cmg</code>, and the wire between <code>nvd</code>/<code>jqt</code>, you will <em>divide the components into two separate, disconnected groups</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><em>9</em></code> components: <code>cmg</code>, <code>frs</code>, <code>lhk</code>, <code>lsr</code>, <code>nvd</code>, <code>pzl</code>, <code>qnr</code>, <code>rsh</code>, and <code>rzs</code>.</li>
<li><code><em>6</em></code> components: <code>bvb</code>, <code>hfx</code>, <code>jqt</code>, <code>ntq</code>, <code>rhn</code>, and <code>xhk</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiplying the sizes of these groups together produces <code><em>54</em></code>.</p>
<p>Find the three wires you need to disconnect in order to divide the components into two separate groups. <em>What do you get if you multiply the sizes of these two groups together?</em></p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>562978</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>You climb over weather machines, under giant springs, and narrowly avoid a pile of pipes as you find and disconnect the three wires.</p>
<p>A moment after you disconnect the last wire, the big red reset button module makes a small ding noise:</p>
<pre><code>System overload resolved!
Power required is now <em class="star">50 stars</em>.
</code></pre>
<p>Out of the corner of your eye, you notice goggles and a loose-fitting hard hat peeking at you from behind an ultra crucible. You think you see a <span title="i help">faint glow</span>, but before you can investigate, you hear another small ding:</p>
<pre><code>Power required is now <em class="star">49 stars</em>.

Please supply the necessary stars and
push the button to restart the system.

      <style>article *[title]{border-bottom:1px dotted #ffff66;}</style><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 24: Never Tell Me The Odds ---</h2><p>It seems like something is going wrong with the snow-making process. Instead of forming snow, the water that's been absorbed into the air seems to be forming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail" target="_blank">hail</a>!</p>
<p>Maybe there's something you can do to break up the hailstones?</p>
<p>Due to strong, probably-magical winds, the hailstones are all flying through the air in perfectly linear trajectories. You make a note of each hailstone's <em>position</em> and <em>velocity</em> (your puzzle input). For example:</p>
<pre><code>19, 13, 30 @ -2,  1, -2
18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2
20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4
12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1
20, 19, 15 @  1, -5, -3
</code></pre>
<p>Each line of text corresponds to the position and velocity of a single hailstone. The positions indicate where the hailstones are <em>right now</em> (at time <code>0</code>). The velocities are constant and indicate exactly how far each hailstone will move in <em>one nanosecond</em>.</p>
<p>Each line of text uses the format <code>px py pz @ vx vy vz</code>. For instance, the hailstone specified by <code>20, 19, 15 @  1, -5, -3</code> has initial X position <code>20</code>, Y position <code>19</code>, Z position <code>15</code>, X velocity <code>1</code>, Y velocity <code>-5</code>, and Z velocity <code>-3</code>. After one nanosecond, the hailstone would be at <code>21, 14, 12</code>.</p>
<p>Perhaps you won't have to do anything. How likely are the hailstones to collide with each other and smash into tiny ice crystals?</p>
<p>To estimate this, consider only the X and Y axes; <em>ignore the Z axis</em>. Looking <em>forward in time</em>, how many of the hailstones' <em>paths</em> will intersect within a test area? (The hailstones themselves don't have to collide, just test for intersections between the paths they will trace.)</p>
<p>In this example, look for intersections that happen with an X and Y position each at least <code>7</code> and at most <code>27</code>; in your actual data, you'll need to check a much larger test area. Comparing all pairs of hailstones' future paths produces the following results:</p>
<pre><code>Hailstone A: 19, 13, 30 @ -2, 1, -2
Hailstone B: 18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2
Hailstones' paths will cross <em>inside</em> the test area (at x=14.333, y=15.333).

Hailstone A: 19, 13, 30 @ -2, 1, -2
Hailstone B: 20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4
Hailstones' paths will cross <em>inside</em> the test area (at x=11.667, y=16.667).

Hailstone A: 19, 13, 30 @ -2, 1, -2
Hailstone B: 12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1
Hailstones' paths will cross outside the test area (at x=6.2, y=19.4).

Hailstone A: 19, 13, 30 @ -2, 1, -2
Hailstone B: 20, 19, 15 @ 1, -5, -3
Hailstones' paths crossed in the past for hailstone A.

Hailstone A: 18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2
Hailstone B: 20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4
Hailstones' paths are parallel; they never intersect.

Hailstone A: 18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2
Hailstone B: 12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1
Hailstones' paths will cross outside the test area (at x=-6, y=-5).

Hailstone A: 18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2
Hailstone B: 20, 19, 15 @ 1, -5, -3
Hailstones' paths crossed in the past for both hailstones.

Hailstone A: 20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4
Hailstone B: 12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1
Hailstones' paths will cross outside the test area (at x=-2, y=3).

Hailstone A: 20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4
Hailstone B: 20, 19, 15 @ 1, -5, -3
Hailstones' paths crossed in the past for hailstone B.

Hailstone A: 12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1
Hailstone B: 20, 19, 15 @ 1, -5, -3
Hailstones' paths crossed in the past for both hailstones.
</code></pre>
<p>So, in this example, <code><em>2</em></code> hailstones' future paths cross inside the boundaries of the test area.</p>
<p>However, you'll need to search a much larger test area if you want to see if any hailstones might collide. Look for intersections that happen with an X and Y position each at least <code>200000000000000</code> and at most <code>400000000000000</code>. Disregard the Z axis entirely.</p>
<p>Considering only the X and Y axes, check all pairs of hailstones' future paths for intersections. <em>How many of these intersections occur within the test area?</em></p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>13965</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Upon further analysis, it doesn't seem like <em>any</em> hailstones will naturally collide. It's up to you to fix that!</p>
<p>You find a rock on the ground nearby. While it seems extremely unlikely, if you throw it just right, you should be able to <em>hit every hailstone in a single throw</em>!</p>
<p>You can use the probably-magical winds to reach <em>any integer position</em> you like and to propel the rock at <em>any integer velocity</em>. Now <em>including the Z axis</em> in your calculations, if you throw the rock at time <code>0</code>, where do you need to be so that the rock <em>perfectly collides with every hailstone</em>? Due to <span title="What, you've never studied probably-magical physics?">probably-magical inertia</span>, the rock won't slow down or change direction when it collides with a hailstone.</p>
<p>In the example above, you can achieve this by moving to position <code>24, 13, 10</code> and throwing the rock at velocity <code>-3, 1, 2</code>. If you do this, you will hit every hailstone as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Hailstone: 19, 13, 30 @ -2, 1, -2
Collision time: 5
Collision position: 9, 18, 20

Hailstone: 18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2
Collision time: 3
Collision position: 15, 16, 16

Hailstone: 20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4
Collision time: 4
Collision position: 12, 17, 18

Hailstone: 12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1
Collision time: 6
Collision position: 6, 19, 22

Hailstone: 20, 19, 15 @ 1, -5, -3
Collision time: 1
Collision position: 21, 14, 12
</code></pre>
<p>Above, each hailstone is identified by its initial position and its velocity. Then, the time and position of that hailstone's collision with your rock are given.</p>
<p>After 1 nanosecond, the rock has <em>exactly the same position</em> as one of the hailstones, obliterating it into ice dust! Another hailstone is smashed to bits two nanoseconds after that. After a total of 6 nanoseconds, all of the hailstones have been destroyed.</p>
<p>So, at time <code>0</code>, the rock needs to be at X position <code>24</code>, Y position <code>13</code>, and Z position <code>10</code>. Adding these three coordinates together produces <code><em>47</em></code>. (Don't add any coordinates from the rock's velocity.)</p>
<p>Determine the exact position and velocity the rock needs to have at time <code>0</code> so that it perfectly collides with every hailstone. <em>What do you get if you add up the X, Y, and Z coordinates of that initial position?</em></p>

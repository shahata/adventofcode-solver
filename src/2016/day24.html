You simply can't reach them.</p>
<p>The robot that cleans the air ducts, however, <em>can</em>.</p>
<p>It's not a very fast <span title="The Brave Little Air Duct Cleaning Robot That Could">little robot</span>, but you reconfigure it to be able to interface with some of the exposed wires that have been routed through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HVAC">HVAC</a> system. If you can direct it to each of those locations, you should be able to bypass the security controls.</p>
<p>You extract the duct layout for this area from some blueprints you acquired and create a map with the relevant locations marked (your puzzle input). <code>0</code> is your current location, from which the cleaning robot embarks; the other numbers are (in <em>no particular order</em>) the locations the robot needs to visit at least once each. Walls are marked as <code>#</code>, and open passages are marked as <code>.</code>. Numbers behave like open passages.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have a map like the following:</p>
<pre><code>###########
#0.1.....2#
#.#######.#
#4.......3#
###########
</code></pre>
<p>To reach all of the points of interest as quickly as possible, you would have the robot take the following path:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0</code> to <code>4</code> (<code>2</code> steps)</li>
<li><code>4</code> to <code>1</code> (<code>4</code> steps; it can't move diagonally)</li>
<li><code>1</code> to <code>2</code> (<code>6</code> steps)</li>
<li><code>2</code> to <code>3</code> (<code>2</code> steps)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the robot isn't very fast, you need to find it the <em>shortest route</em>. This path is the fewest steps (in the above example, a total of <code>14</code>) required to start at <code>0</code> and then visit every other location at least once.</p>
<p>Given your actual map, and starting from location <code>0</code>, what is the <em>fewest number of steps</em> required to visit every non-<code>0</code> number marked on the map at least once?</p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>412</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Of course, if you leave the cleaning robot somewhere weird, someone is bound to notice.</p>
<p>What is the fewest number of steps required to start at <code>0</code>, visit every non-<code>0</code> number marked on the map at least once, and then <em>return to <code>0</code></em>?</p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>664</code>.</p><p class="day-success">Both parts of this puzzle are complete! They provide two gold stars: **</p>

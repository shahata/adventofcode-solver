<style>article *[title]{border-bottom:1px dotted #ffff66;}</style><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 19: Not Enough Minerals ---</h2><p>Your scans show that the lava did indeed form obsidian!</p>
<p>The wind has changed direction enough to stop sending lava droplets toward you, so you and the elephants exit the cave. As you do, you notice a collection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geode" target="_blank">geodes</a> around the pond. Perhaps you could use the obsidian to create some <em>geode-cracking robots</em> and break them open?</p>
<p>To collect the obsidian from the bottom of the pond, you'll need waterproof <em>obsidian-collecting robots</em>. Fortunately, there is an abundant amount of clay nearby that you can use to make them waterproof.</p>
<p>In order to harvest the clay, you'll need special-purpose <em>clay-collecting robots</em>. To make any type of robot, you'll need <em>ore</em>, which is also plentiful but in the opposite direction from the clay.</p>
<p>Collecting ore requires <em>ore-collecting robots</em> with big drills. Fortunately, <em>you have exactly one ore-collecting robot</em> in your pack that you can use to <span title="If You Give A Mouse An Ore-Collecting Robot">kickstart</span> the whole operation.</p>
<p>Each robot can collect 1 of its resource type per minute. It also takes one minute for the robot factory (also conveniently from your pack) to construct any type of robot, although it consumes the necessary resources available when construction begins.</p>
<p>The robot factory has many <em>blueprints</em> (your puzzle input) you can choose from, but once you've configured it with a blueprint, you can't change it. You'll need to work out which blueprint is best.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>Blueprint 1:
  Each ore robot costs 4 ore.
  Each clay robot costs 2 ore.
  Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 14 clay.
  Each geode robot costs 2 ore and 7 obsidian.

Blueprint 2:
  Each ore robot costs 2 ore.
  Each clay robot costs 3 ore.
  Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 8 clay.
  Each geode robot costs 3 ore and 12 obsidian.
</code></pre>
<p>(Blueprints have been line-wrapped here for legibility. The robot factory's actual assortment of blueprints are provided one blueprint per line.)</p>
<p>The elephants are starting to look hungry, so you shouldn't take too long; you need to figure out which blueprint would maximize the number of opened geodes after <em>24 minutes</em> by figuring out which robots to build and when to build them.</p>
<p>Using blueprint 1 in the example above, the largest number of geodes you could open in 24 minutes is <code><em>9</em></code>. One way to achieve that is:</p>

<p>However, by using blueprint 2 in the example above, you could do even better: the largest number of geodes you could open in 24 minutes is <code><em>12</em></code>.</p>
<p>Determine the <em>quality level</em> of each blueprint by <em>multiplying that blueprint's ID number</em> with the largest number of geodes that can be opened in 24 minutes using that blueprint. In this example, the first blueprint has ID 1 and can open 9 geodes, so its quality level is <code><em>9</em></code>. The second blueprint has ID 2 and can open 12 geodes, so its quality level is <code><em>24</em></code>. Finally, if you <em>add up the quality levels</em> of all of the blueprints in the list, you get <code><em>33</em></code>.</p>
<p>Determine the quality level of each blueprint using the largest number of geodes it could produce in 24 minutes. <em>What do you get if you add up the quality level of all of the blueprints in your list?</em></p>

<p>Unfortunately, one of the elephants <em>ate most of your blueprint list</em>! Now, only the first three blueprints in your list are intact.</p>

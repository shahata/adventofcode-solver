<style>article *[title]{border-bottom:1px dotted #ffff66;}</style><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 24: Planet of Discord ---</h2><p>You land on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_(dwarf_planet)">Eris</a>, your last stop before reaching Santa.  As soon as you do, your sensors start picking up strange life forms moving around: Eris is infested with <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/thisday/sep9/worlds-first-computer-bug/">bugs</a>! With an <span title="For a sad version of this story, look up Voices of a Distant Star.">over 24-hour roundtrip</span> for messages between you and Earth, you'll have to deal with this problem on your own.</p>
<p>Eris isn't a very large place; a scan of the entire area fits into a 5x5 grid (your puzzle input). The scan shows <em>bugs</em> (<code>#</code>) and <em>empty spaces</em> (<code>.</code>).</p>
<p>Each <em>minute</em>, The bugs live and die based on the number of bugs in the <em>four adjacent tiles</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bug <em>dies</em> (becoming an empty space) unless there is <em>exactly one</em> bug adjacent to it.</li>
<li>An empty space <em>becomes infested</em> with a bug if <em>exactly one or two</em> bugs are adjacent to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, a bug or empty space remains the same.  (Tiles on the edges of the grid have fewer than four adjacent tiles; the missing tiles count as empty space.) This process happens in every location <em>simultaneously</em>; that is, within the same minute, the number of adjacent bugs is counted for every tile first, and then the tiles are updated.</p>
<p>Here are the first few minutes of an example scenario:</p>
<pre><code>Initial state:
....#
#..#.
#..##
..#..
#....

After 1 minute:
#..#.
####.
###.#
##.##
.##..

After 2 minutes:
#####
....#
....#
...#.
#.###

After 3 minutes:
#....
####.
...##
#.##.
.##.#

After 4 minutes:
####.
....#
##..#
.....
##...
</code></pre>
<p>To understand the nature of the bugs, watch for the first time a layout of bugs and empty spaces <em>matches any previous layout</em>. In the example above, the first layout to appear twice is:</p>
<pre><code>.....
.....
.....
#....
.#...
</code></pre>
<p>To calculate the <em>biodiversity rating</em> for this layout, consider each tile left-to-right in the top row, then left-to-right in the second row, and so on. Each of these tiles is worth biodiversity points equal to <em>increasing powers of two</em>: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on.  Add up the biodiversity points for tiles with bugs; in this example, the 16th tile (<code>32768</code> points) and 22nd tile (<code>2097152</code> points) have bugs, a total biodiversity rating of <code><em>2129920</em></code>.</p>
<p><em>What is the biodiversity rating for the first layout that appears twice?</em></p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>14539258</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>After careful analysis, one thing is certain: <em>you have no idea where all these bugs are coming from</em>.</p>
<p>Then, you remember: Eris is an old <a href="day20.html">Plutonian</a> settlement! Clearly, the bugs are coming from recursively-folded space.</p>
<p>This 5x5 grid is <em>only one</em> level in an <em>infinite</em> number of recursion levels. The tile in the middle of the grid is actually another 5x5 grid, the grid in your scan is contained as the middle tile of a larger 5x5 grid, and so on. Two levels of grids look like this:</p>
<pre><code>     |     |         |     |     
     |     |         |     |     
     |     |         |     |     
-----+-----+---------+-----+-----
     |     |         |     |     
     |     |         |     |     
     |     |         |     |     
-----+-----+---------+-----+-----
     |     | | | | | |     |     
     |     |-+-+-+-+-|     |

     |     | | |?| | |     |     
     |     |-+-+-+-+-|     |     
     |     | | | | | |     |

     |     | | | | | |     |

     |     |         |     |     
     |     |         |     |     
</code></pre>
<p>(To save space, some of the tiles are not drawn to scale.)  Remember, this is only a small part of the infinitely recursive grid; there is a 5x5 grid that contains this diagram, and a 5x5 grid that contains that one, and so on.  Also, the <code>?</code> in the diagram contains another 5x5 grid, which itself contains another 5x5 grid, and so on.</p>
<p>The scan you took (your puzzle input) shows where the bugs are <em>on a single level</em> of this structure. The middle tile of your scan is empty to accommodate the recursive grids within it. Initially, no other levels contain bugs.</p>
<p>Tiles still count as <em>adjacent</em> if they are directly <em>up, down, left, or right</em> of a given tile. Some tiles have adjacent tiles at a recursion level above or below its own level. For example:</p>
<pre><code>     |     |         |     |     
  1  |  2  |    3    |  4  |  5

<ul>
<li>Tile 19 has four adjacent tiles: 14, 18, 20, and 24.</li>
<li>Tile G has four adjacent tiles: B, F, H, and L.</li>
<li>Tile D has four adjacent tiles: 8, C, E, and I.</li>
<li>Tile E has four adjacent tiles: 8, D, 14, and J.</li>
<li>Tile 14 has <em>eight</em> adjacent tiles: 9, E, J, O, T, Y, 15, and 19.</li>
<li>Tile N has <em>eight</em> adjacent tiles: I, O, S, and five tiles within the sub-grid marked <code>?</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rules about bugs living and dying are the same as before.</p>
<p>For example, consider the same initial state as above:</p>
<pre><code>....#
#..#.
#.?##
..#..
#....
</code></pre>
<p>The center tile is drawn as <code>?</code> to indicate the next recursive grid. Call this level 0; the grid within this one is level 1, and the grid that contains this one is level -1.  Then, after <em>ten</em> minutes, the grid at each level would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Depth -5:
..#..
.#.#.
..?.#
.#.#.
..#..

Depth -4:
...#.
...##
..?..

Depth -3:

Depth -2:

.###.

Depth -1:

Depth 0:

Depth 1:

<p>In this example, after 10 minutes, a total of <code><em>99</em></code> bugs are present.</p>
<p>Starting with your scan, <em>how many bugs are present after 200 minutes?</em></p>

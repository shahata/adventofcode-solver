        <h2>--- Day 8: Handheld Halting ---</h2>
        <p>Your flight to the major airline hub reaches cruising altitude without incident. While you consider checking
          the in-flight menu for one of those drinks that come with a little umbrella, you are interrupted by the kid
          sitting next to you.</p>
        <p>Their <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handheld_game_console">handheld game console</a>
          won't turn on! They ask if you can take a look.</p>
        <p>You narrow the problem down to a strange <em>infinite loop</em> in the <span
            title="A trendy new line of encrypted footwear?">boot code</span> (your puzzle input) of the device. You
          should be able to fix it, but first you need to be able to run the code in isolation.</p>
        <p>The boot code is represented as a text file with one <em>instruction</em> per line of text. Each instruction
          consists of an <em>operation</em> (<code>acc</code>, <code>jmp</code>, or <code>nop</code>) and an
          <em>argument</em> (a signed number like <code>+4</code> or <code>-20</code>).</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>acc</code> increases or decreases a single global value called the <em>accumulator</em> by the value
            given in the argument. For example, <code>acc +7</code> would increase the accumulator by 7. The accumulator
            starts at <code>0</code>. After an <code>acc</code> instruction, the instruction immediately below it is
            executed next.</li>
          <li><code>jmp</code> <em>jumps</em> to a new instruction relative to itself. The next instruction to execute
            is found using the argument as an <em>offset</em> from the <code>jmp</code> instruction; for example,
            <code>jmp +2</code> would skip the next instruction, <code>jmp +1</code> would continue to the instruction
            immediately below it, and <code>jmp -20</code> would cause the instruction 20 lines above to be executed
            next.</li>
          <li><code>nop</code> stands for <em>No OPeration</em> - it does nothing. The instruction immediately below it
            is executed next.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, consider the following program:</p>
        <pre><code>nop +0
acc +1
jmp +4
acc +3
jmp -3
acc -99
acc +1
jmp -4
acc +6
</code></pre>
        <p>These instructions are visited in this order:</p>
        <pre><code>nop +0  | 1
acc +1  | 2, 8(!)
jmp +4  | 3
acc +3  | 6
jmp -3  | 7
acc -99 |
acc +1  | 4
jmp -4  | 5
acc +6  |
</code></pre>
        <p>First, the <code>nop +0</code> does nothing. Then, the accumulator is increased from 0 to 1
          (<code>acc +1</code>) and <code>jmp +4</code> sets the next instruction to the other <code>acc +1</code> near
          the bottom. After it increases the accumulator from 1 to 2, <code>jmp -4</code> executes, setting the next
          instruction to the only <code>acc +3</code>. It sets the accumulator to 5, and <code>jmp -3</code> causes the
          program to continue back at the first <code>acc +1</code>.</p>
        <p>This is an <em>infinite loop</em>: with this sequence of jumps, the program will run forever. The moment the
          program tries to run any instruction a second time, you know it will never terminate.</p>
        <p>Immediately <em>before</em> the program would run an instruction a second time, the value in the accumulator
          is <em><code>5</code></em>.</p>
        <p>Run your copy of the boot code. Immediately before any instruction is executed a second time, <em>what value
            is in the accumulator?</em></p>
      </article>
      <p>Your puzzle answer was <code>1548</code>.</p>
      <article class="day-desc">
        <h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2>
        <p>After some careful analysis, you believe that <em>exactly one instruction is corrupted</em>.</p>
        <p>Somewhere in the program, <em>either</em> a <code>jmp</code> is supposed to be a <code>nop</code>,
          <em>or</em> a <code>nop</code> is supposed to be a <code>jmp</code>. (No <code>acc</code> instructions were
          harmed in the corruption of this boot code.)</p>
        <p>The program is supposed to terminate by <em>attempting to execute an instruction immediately after the last
            instruction in the file</em>. By changing exactly one <code>jmp</code> or <code>nop</code>, you can repair
          the boot code and make it terminate correctly.</p>
        <p>For example, consider the same program from above:</p>
        <pre><code>nop +0
acc +1
jmp +4
acc +3
jmp -3
acc -99
acc +1
jmp -4
acc +6
</code></pre>
        <p>If you change the first instruction from <code>nop +0</code> to <code>jmp +0</code>, it would create a
          single-instruction infinite loop, never leaving that instruction. If you change almost any of the
          <code>jmp</code> instructions, the program will still eventually find another <code>jmp</code> instruction and
          loop forever.</p>
        <p>However, if you change the second-to-last instruction (from <code>jmp -4</code> to <code>nop -4</code>), the
          program terminates! The instructions are visited in this order:</p>
        <pre><code>nop +0  | 1
acc +1  | 2
jmp +4  | 3
acc +3  |
jmp -3  |
acc -99 |
acc +1  | 4
<em>nop</em> -4  | 5
acc +6  | 6
</code></pre>
        <p>After the last instruction (<code>acc +6</code>), the program terminates by attempting to run the instruction
          below the last instruction in the file. With this change, after the program terminates, the accumulator
          contains the value <em><code>8</code></em> (<code>acc +1</code>, <code>acc +1</code>, <code>acc +6</code>).
        </p>
        <p>Fix the program so that it terminates normally by changing exactly one <code>jmp</code> (to <code>nop</code>)
          or <code>nop</code> (to <code>jmp</code>). <em>What is the value of the accumulator after the program
            terminates?</em></p>

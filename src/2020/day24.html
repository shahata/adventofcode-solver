      <style>article *[title]{border-bottom:1px dotted #ffff66;}</style><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 24: Lobby Layout ---</h2><p>Your raft makes it to the tropical island; it turns out that the small crab was an excellent navigator. You make your way to the resort.</p>
<p>As you enter the lobby, you discover a small problem: the floor is being renovated. You can't even reach the check-in desk until they've finished installing the <em>new tile floor</em>.</p>
<p>The tiles are all <em>hexagonal</em>; they need to be arranged in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_tiling">hex grid</a> with a very specific color pattern. Not in the mood to wait, you offer to help figure out the pattern.</p>
<p>The tiles are all <em>white</em> on one side and <em>black</em> on the other. They start with the white side facing up. The lobby is large enough to fit whatever pattern might need to appear there.</p>
<p>A member of the renovation crew gives you a <em>list of the tiles that need to be flipped over</em> (your puzzle input). Each line in the list identifies a single tile that needs to be flipped by giving a series of steps starting from a <em>reference tile</em> in the very center of the room. (Every line starts from the same reference tile.)</p>
<p>Because the tiles are hexagonal, every tile has <em>six neighbors</em>: east, southeast, southwest, west, northwest, and northeast. These directions are given in your list, respectively, as <code>e</code>, <code>se</code>, <code>sw</code>, <code>w</code>, <code>nw</code>, and <code>ne</code>. A tile is identified by a series of these directions with <em>no delimiters</em>; for example, <code>esenee</code> identifies the tile you land on if you start at the reference tile and then move one tile east, one tile southeast, one tile northeast, and one tile east.</p>
<p>Each time a tile is identified, it flips from white to black or from black to white. Tiles might be flipped more than once. For example, a line like <code>esew</code> flips a tile immediately adjacent to the reference tile, and a line like <code>nwwswee</code> flips the reference tile itself.</p>
<p>Here is a larger example:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, 10 tiles are flipped once (to black), and 5 more are flipped twice (to black, then back to white). After all of these instructions have been followed, a total of <em><code>10</code></em> tiles are <em>black</em>.</p>
<p>Go through the renovation crew's list and determine which tiles they need to flip. After all of the instructions have been followed, <em>how many tiles are left with the black side up?</em></p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>287</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>The tile floor in the lobby is meant to be a <span title="I need one of these!">living art exhibit</span>. Every day, the tiles are all flipped according to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any <em>black</em> tile with <em>zero</em> or <em>more than 2</em> black tiles immediately adjacent to it is flipped to <em>white</em>.</li>
<li>Any <em>white</em> tile with <em>exactly 2</em> black tiles immediately adjacent to it is flipped to <em>black</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, <em>tiles immediately adjacent</em> means the six tiles directly touching the tile in question.</p>
<p>The rules are applied <em>simultaneously</em> to every tile; put another way, it is first determined which tiles need to be flipped, then they are all flipped at the same time.</p>
<p>In the above example, the number of black tiles that are facing up after the given number of days has passed is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Day 1: 15
Day 2: 12
Day 3: 25
Day 4: 14
Day 5: 23
Day 6: 28
Day 7: 41
Day 8: 37
Day 9: 49
Day 10: 37

Day 20: 132
Day 30: 259
Day 40: 406
Day 50: 566
Day 60: 788
Day 70: 1106
Day 80: 1373
Day 90: 1844
Day 100: 2208
</code></pre>
<p>After executing this process a total of 100 times, there would be <em><code>2208</code></em> black tiles facing up.</p>
<p><em>How many tiles will be black after 100 days?</em></p>

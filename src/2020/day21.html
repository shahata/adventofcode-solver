There aren't even any boats here, but nothing can stop you now: you build a raft. You just need a few days' worth of food for your journey.</p>
<p>You don't speak the local language, so you can't read any ingredients lists. However, sometimes, allergens are listed in a language you <em>do</em> understand. You should be able to use this information to determine which ingredient contains which allergen and <span title="I actually considered doing this once. I do not recommend it.">work out which foods are safe</span> to take with you on your trip.</p>
<p>You start by compiling a list of foods (your puzzle input), one food per line. Each line includes that food's <em>ingredients list</em> followed by some or all of the allergens the food contains.</p>
<p>Each allergen is found in exactly one ingredient. Each ingredient contains zero or one allergen. <em>Allergens aren't always marked</em>; when they're listed (as in <code>(contains nuts, shellfish)</code> after an ingredients list), the ingredient that contains each listed allergen will be <em>somewhere in the corresponding ingredients list</em>. However, even if an allergen isn't listed, the ingredient that contains that allergen could still be present: maybe they forgot to label it, or maybe it was labeled in a language you don't know.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following list of foods:</p>
<pre><code>mxmxvkd kfcds sqjhc nhms (contains dairy, fish)
trh fvjkl sbzzf mxmxvkd (contains dairy)
sqjhc fvjkl (contains soy)
sqjhc mxmxvkd sbzzf (contains fish)
</code></pre>
<p>The first food in the list has four ingredients (written in a language you don't understand): <code>mxmxvkd</code>, <code>kfcds</code>, <code>sqjhc</code>, and <code>nhms</code>. While the food might contain other allergens, a few allergens the food definitely contains are listed afterward: <code>dairy</code> and <code>fish</code>.</p>
<p>The first step is to determine which ingredients <em>can't possibly</em> contain any of the allergens in any food in your list. In the above example, none of the ingredients <code>kfcds</code>, <code>nhms</code>, <code>sbzzf</code>, or <code>trh</code> can contain an allergen. Counting the number of times any of these ingredients appear in any ingredients list produces <em><code>5</code></em>: they all appear once each except <code>sbzzf</code>, which appears twice.</p>
<p>Determine which ingredients cannot possibly contain any of the allergens in your list. <em>How many times do any of those ingredients appear?</em></p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>2556</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Now that you've isolated the inert ingredients, you should have enough information to figure out which ingredient contains which allergen.</p>
<p>In the above example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mxmxvkd</code> contains <code>dairy</code>.</li>
<li><code>sqjhc</code> contains <code>fish</code>.</li>
<li><code>fvjkl</code> contains <code>soy</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arrange the ingredients <em>alphabetically by their allergen</em> and separate them by commas to produce your <em>canonical dangerous ingredient list</em>. (There should <em>not be any spaces</em> in your canonical dangerous ingredient list.) In the above example, this would be <em><code>mxmxvkd,sqjhc,fvjkl</code></em>.</p>
<p>Time to stock your raft with supplies. <em>What is your canonical dangerous ingredient list?</em></p>

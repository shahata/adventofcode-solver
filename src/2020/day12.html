The ferry needs to take <em>evasive actions</em>!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the ship's navigation computer seems to be malfunctioning; rather than giving a route directly to safety, it produced extremely circuitous instructions. When the captain uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address_system" target="_blank">PA system</a> to ask if anyone can help, you quickly volunteer.</p>
<p>The navigation instructions (your puzzle input) consists of a sequence of single-character <em>actions</em> paired with integer input <em>values</em>. After staring at them for a few minutes, you work out what they probably mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Action <em><code>N</code></em> means to move <em>north</em> by the given value.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>S</code></em> means to move <em>south</em> by the given value.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>E</code></em> means to move <em>east</em> by the given value.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>W</code></em> means to move <em>west</em> by the given value.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>L</code></em> means to turn <em>left</em> the given number of degrees.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>R</code></em> means to turn <em>right</em> the given number of degrees.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>F</code></em> means to move <em>forward</em> by the given value in the direction the ship is currently facing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ship starts by facing <em>east</em>. Only the <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> actions change the direction the ship is facing. (That is, if the ship is facing east and the next instruction is <code>N10</code>, the ship would move north 10 units, but would still move east if the following action were <code>F</code>.)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>F10
N3
F7
R90
F11
</code></pre>
<p>These instructions would be handled as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>F10</code> would move the ship 10 units east (because the ship starts by facing east) to <em>east 10, north 0</em>.</li>
<li><code>N3</code> would move the ship 3 units north to <em>east 10, north 3</em>.</li>
<li><code>F7</code> would move the ship another 7 units east (because the ship is still facing east) to <em>east 17, north 3</em>.</li>
<li><code>R90</code> would cause the ship to turn right by 90 degrees and face <em>south</em>; it remains at <em>east 17, north 3</em>.</li>
<li><code>F11</code> would move the ship 11 units south to <em>east 17, south 8</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of these instructions, the ship's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance" target="_blank">Manhattan distance</a> (sum of the absolute values of its east/west position and its north/south position) from its starting position is <code>17 + 8</code> = <em><code>25</code></em>.</p>
<p>Figure out where the navigation instructions lead. <em>What is the Manhattan distance between that location and the ship's starting position?</em></p>

<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>2847</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Before you can give the destination to the captain, you realize that the actual action meanings were printed on the back of the instructions the whole time.</p>
<p>Almost all of the actions indicate how to move a <em>waypoint</em> which is relative to the ship's position:</p>
<ul>
<li>Action <em><code>N</code></em> means to move the waypoint <em>north</em> by the given value.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>S</code></em> means to move the waypoint <em>south</em> by the given value.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>E</code></em> means to move the waypoint <em>east</em> by the given value.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>W</code></em> means to move the waypoint <em>west</em> by the given value.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>L</code></em> means to rotate the waypoint around the ship <em>left</em> (<em>counter-clockwise</em>) the given number of degrees.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>R</code></em> means to rotate the waypoint around the ship <em>right</em> (<em>clockwise</em>) the given number of degrees.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>F</code></em> means to move <em>forward</em> to the waypoint a number of times equal to the given value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The waypoint starts <em>10 units east and 1 unit north</em> relative to the ship. The waypoint is relative to the ship; that is, if the ship moves, the waypoint moves with it.</p>
<p>For example, using the same instructions as above:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>F10</code> moves the ship to the waypoint 10 times (a total of <em>100 units east and 10 units north</em>), leaving the ship at <em>east 100, north 10</em>. The waypoint stays 10 units east and 1 unit north of the ship.</li>
<li><code>N3</code> moves the waypoint 3 units north to <em>10 units east and 4 units north of the ship</em>. The ship remains at <em>east 100, north 10</em>.</li>
<li><code>F7</code> moves the ship to the waypoint 7 times (a total of <em>70 units east and 28 units north</em>), leaving the ship at <em>east 170, north 38</em>. The waypoint stays 10 units east and 4 units north of the ship.</li>
<li><code>R90</code> rotates the waypoint around the ship clockwise 90 degrees, moving it to <em>4 units east and 10 units south of the ship</em>. The ship remains at <em>east 170, north 38</em>.</li>
<li><code>F11</code> moves the ship to the waypoint 11 times (a total of <em>44 units east and 110 units south</em>), leaving the ship at <em>east 214, south 72</em>. The waypoint stays 4 units east and 10 units south of the ship.</li>
</ul>
<p>After these operations, the ship's Manhattan distance from its starting position is <code>214 + 72</code> = <em><code>286</code></em>.</p>
<p>Figure out where the navigation instructions actually lead. <em>What is the Manhattan distance between that location and the ship's starting position?</em></p>
